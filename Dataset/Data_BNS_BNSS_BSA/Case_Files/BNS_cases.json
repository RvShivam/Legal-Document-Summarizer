BAIL APPLICATION No. - 35919 of 2024 Applicant :- Rana Pratap Yadav Opposite Party :- State of U.P. Counsel for Applicant :- Dheeraj Kumar Pandey,Surya Pratap Singh Parmar Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A. Hon'ble Ashutosh Srivastava,J. Heard Sri D. K. Pandey, learned counsel for the applicant, learned A.G.A. for the State Respondent and perused the record of the case. The present bail application has been filed on behalf of applicant Rana Pratap Yadav, under Section 439 of The Code of Criminal Procedure, with a prayer to release him on bail in Case Crime No. 54 of 2024, under Sections 319(2), 318(4), 338, 336(3), 340(2) of the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita and Section 8/20 of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, and Section 207 of the Motor Vehicle Act, registered at Police Station Unj, District Bhadohi, during pendency of the trial. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that as per version of the FIR, during the checking on 04.08.2024, a Baleno Navy Blue Colour Car having chassis number MBHHWV135NB113246 and engine number K12NP7014695 and another vehicle having number plate JH-10-AB-2575 was found to be carrying 200 kg of illegal ganja in a total of 200 packets, which were arrested by the police and illegal ganja was recovered. On checking the said Baleno Car from the e-challan app, the engine Rana Pratap Yadav vs State Of U.P. on 17 January, 2025 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/50269991/ 1 number was found to be DBA1626844 and the chassis number was MA3FFEB1500190210, whereas the engine number on the vehicle is M16AN2018923. Learned counsel for the applicant further submits that on the basis of prior information given by Mukhbir, the Police recovered 200 KG of Ganja from the aforesaid vehicles. The role of the applicant is stated to be in smuggling of ganja and he has been arrested from the spot along with other co-accused. Further the accused used the fake number plate in the alleged vehicle. 100 packets of Ganja were recovered from both the vehicles, the total quantity of which is shown to be 200 KG. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present case due to ulterior motive. It is further submitted that the alleged contraband of 200 KG of Ganja has not been recovered from the personal possession of the applicant. He further submits that the alleged recovery of 200 KG of Ganja, as shown in the first information report, which is above the commercial quantity, is made without complying the mandatory provisions of Sections 42 & 50 of the N.D.P.S. Act and Section 100 and 102 Cr.P.C. There is no independent eye-witness of the alleged recovery from the possession of the applicant. It is further submitted that there is no adequate or substantial compliance with Section 52-A of the N.D.P.S. Act. It is further submitted that in order to make search and recovery of the contraband articles from the body of the applicant, search and recovery has to be inconformity with the requirements of Section 50 of the N.D.P.S. Act. It is further submitted that the applicant has no criminal history. It is next submitted that there is also no possibility of the applicant either fleeing away from the judicial process or tampering with the witnesses. The applicant, who is languishing in jail since 04.08.2024, undertakes that he will not misuse the liberty, if granted. It has also been pointed out that in the wake of heavy pendency of cases in the Court, there is no likelihood of any early conclusion of trial. Learned AGA submits that the applicant was arrested on the spot. He has further submitted that it is an admitted fact that the recovery of 200 KG of Ganja, which is more than the commercial quantity, has been recovered from the possession of the applicant, hence, Section 37 of NDPS Act is attracted in the present case, therefore, the bail application is liable to be rejected. I have considered the rival submissions advanced by learned counsel for the parties and perused the material available on record. It is evident that during the checking, 200 KG of Ganja was recovered from the possession of the applicant, which admittedly is more than the commercial quantity, as such, rigors of Section 37 of the NDPS Act are applicable in the instant case. This Court has considered the recent case of Union of India Vs Md. Nawaz Khan, reported in, AIR 2021 SC 447, which is a case where contraband was concealed in a bag and it was held by Supreme Court that factum of absence of possession of contraband by the accused in itself cannot be sole ground for grant of bail. In paragraph Nos. 20 & 29, it has been said as under:- \"20. Based on the above precedent, the test which the High Court and this Court are required to apply while granting bail is whether there are reasonable grounds to Rana Pratap Yadav vs State Of U.P. on 17 January, 2025 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/50269991/ 2 believe that the accused has not committed an offence and whether he is likely to commit any offence while on bail. Given the seriousness of offences punishable under the NDPS Act and in order to curb the menace of drug-trafficking in the country, stringent parameters for the grant of bail under the NDPS Act have been prescribed. 29.
